## CONTEXT
I'm a software developer creating an **HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) maintenance management system**. I need to generate **realistic and coherent test data** for testing and demonstrations.

## OBJECTIVE
Generate a complete and coherent dataset for an HVAC maintenance management system that includes: **users, clients, equipment, maintenance orders, failures, and inspections.**

## Years
Between 2023-2025

## REQUIRED DATA STRUCTURE

### 1. USERS (16 records)
* **2 Administrators**: Full system access
* **3 Operators**: Administrative management, job assignment
* **6 Technicians**: 4 men, 2 women - perform maintenance and inspections
* **5 Additional Technicians**: For scalability

### 2. CLIENTS (45 distributed records)
* **15 clients** with equipment in good condition (preventive maintenance only)
* **10 clients** with equipment requiring corrective maintenance (compressor/refrigerant)
* **15 clients** with multiple pieces of equipment (1-3 per client) needing diverse maintenance
* **5 clients** with pending inspection orders

### 3. EQUIPMENT (50+ records)
* **Real Brands**: LG, Samsung, Carrier, Daikin, Midea
* **Types**: Split AC, Window AC, Central AC, Heat Pump, Furnace
* **Capacities**: 9,000 - 24,000 BTU (residential/commercial units)
* **Realistic Locations**: "Living Room", "Master Bedroom", "Office Area", etc.
* **Statuses**: Operational, Requires Repair, Out of Service

### 4. MAINTENANCE TYPES (6 types)
* PM (Preventive Maintenance): Cleaning every 5 months
* CM (Corrective Maintenance):
    * Pressure monitoring (2 weeks for critical equipment)
    * Compressor replacement
    * Refrigerant recharge
    * Capacitor replacement
    * Capillary tube replacement

### 5. FAILURE TYPES (13 categories)
* Electrical: Compressor failures, capacitors, fan motors
* Mechanical: High motor vibration, mechanical compressor failure
* Refrigeration: Refrigerant leaks, low charge, capillary tube blockage
* Airflow: Dirty coils
* Control System: Thermostat failures
* Noise/Vibration: Abnormal compressor noise

### 6. MAINTENANCE ORDERS (30+ records)
* Distributed between preventive and corrective
* With statuses: scheduled, in_progress, completed
* With realistic costs: labor, parts, total
* With consistent scheduling and completion dates
* Keep in mind dates between 2025-2026 (you can include those coompleted maintenance, but try to add new orders for future, in order to make this more realistic)

### 7. EQUIPMENT FAILURES (20+ records)
* Linked to specific maintenance orders
* With severities: Low, Medium, High, Critical
* With realistic repair times

### 8. INSPECTIONS (15 records)
* With real technical readings: suction pressure, supply/return temperature, amperage
* Statuses: Pending, Converted to Maintenance, Rejected

## QUALITY CRITERIA

### TEMPORAL COHERENCE
* Installation dates -> warranty dates -> logical maintenance dates
* Temporal sequence: installation -> failure -> inspection -> maintenance order -> resolution

### TECHNICAL COHERENCE
* Pressure/temperature readings within realistic HVAC ranges
* Appropriate BTU for the equipment type and location
* Technical failures that correspond to reported symptoms

### GEOGRAPHICAL COHERENCE
* RFakes addresses
* Local format phone numbers (XX-XXX-XXXX)

### COMMERCIAL COHERENCE
* Realistic costs for labor and parts
* Appropriate work hours for each repair type
* Client ratings based on technician notes

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Complete **SQL script** with:
* Insertions in the correct order (respecting foreign key dependencies)
* Data balanced between different statuses and types
* Consistent ID formats (USER001, CLI001, EQ001, MO001, etc.)
* SQL comments for important sections

## SPECIFIC HVAC TECHNICAL DATA
* Supply Temperature: 55F-65F (cooling), 85F-95F (heating)
* Return Temperature: Ambient temperature (70F-80F)
* Normal Temperature Differential: 15F-22F
* Suction Pressure: 60-75 PSI for R410A
* Amperage: according to equipment capacity (5-15 amps for residential units)
