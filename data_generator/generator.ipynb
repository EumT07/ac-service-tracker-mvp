    "GENERATION GUIDELINES:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TECHNICAL READINGS (R-410A Systems):\n",
    "   - Normal Ranges:\n",
    "     * pressure_suction: 65-80 PSI (summer), 50-65 PSI (winter)\n",
    "     * temp_supply: 50-60°F (should be 15-25°F below return)\n",
    "     * temp_return: 70-80°F (room temperature)\n",
    "     * amps_reading: 10-20A (check against nameplate)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem Indicators:\n",
    "     * Low suction pressure (<60 PSI): Low refrigerant, restriction\n",
    "     * High suction pressure (>85 PSI): Overcharge, bad compressor\n",
    "     * Low temp split (<15°F): Low airflow, undercharge\n",
    "     * High temp split (>25°F): High airflow, overcharge\n",
    "     * High amps: Dirty coils, failing compressor\n",
    "\n",
    "2. INSPECTION SCENARIOS:\n",
    "   - Routine Maintenance Inspection: All readings normal, status 'Rejected'\n",
    "   - Diagnostic Inspection (Poor Cooling): High suction pressure, low temp split → 'Converted'\n",
    "   - Seasonal Check-up: Mixed readings, status 'Pending' for review\n",
    "   - Emergency Diagnostic: Critical readings, immediate 'Converted'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. NOTES CONTENT:\n",
    "   general_notes should include:\n",
    "   - Inspection type and purpose\n",
    "   - Visual observations (cleanliness, physical condition)\n",
    "   - Customer-reported symptoms\n",
    "   - Initial assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "   findings_summary should include:\n",
    "   - Analysis of technical readings\n",
    "   - Specific issues identified\n",
    "   - Recommendations (repair, replace, monitor)\n",
    "   - Estimated repair complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CONVERSION LOGIC:\n",
    "   - Only convert inspections with clear issues requiring repair\n",
    "   - converted_to_maintenance_order_id should reference a CM order\n",
    "   - Conversion typically happens 1-7 days after inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "5. EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:\n",
    "   Scenario 1: Normal Operation\n",
    "   - Readings: 72 PSI, 55°F supply, 75°F return, 12.5A\n",
    "   - Status: 'Rejected'\n",
    "   - Notes: \"System operating within normal parameters\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   Scenario 2: Refrigerant Leak\n",
    "   - Readings: 48 PSI, 62°F supply, 78°F return, 8.5A\n",
    "   - Status: 'Converted to Maintenance'\n",
    "   - Notes: \"Low suction pressure indicates probable refrigerant leak\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   Scenario 3: Dirty Coils\n",
    "   - Readings: 85 PSI, 58°F supply, 76°F return, 18.5A\n",
